# Smart-Parking-System
A communication is established between a PC and a raspberry PI using MQTT protocol. The raspberry PI simulates the parking lot state. Both the raspberry pi and the PC are involved in a bidirectional communication where they continuously publish data as well as receives data through subscription. The PC uses QT designer for this purpose whereas the raspberry PI uses GPIO pins and a temperature sensor.
